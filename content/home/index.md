Hi!
---

You reached my sport statistics site based on my [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/71447788) data. Site source code is in [Github](https://github.com/hhakala/train-hugo), but I haven't released Strava API parser yet. My goal is to release package which helps you to create similar [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site. Technical advantage of Hugo is its static nature, site is only Javascript decorated HTML, so publishing it is free of charge for example as [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) or [Cloudflare Page](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

About me
---

I'm middle aged mediocre jogger, who runs mainly to avoid health pitfalls of getting older. My long term goal is to visit every square kilometer in my province Pirkanmaa, either by running, walking or rowing. I'm tracking my goal progression with [Statshunters](https://www.statshunters.com/share/179518b9b42f). At the moment my progression is below 2%, so project probably continues well after my retirement. I plan my routes with [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/), which has been suprisingly good even in deep forest tracks. There are exceptions in winter and fall though, I have found myself wading thru deep snow and flooded swamps when my route planning has been only carefree clicking at start and end positions.
